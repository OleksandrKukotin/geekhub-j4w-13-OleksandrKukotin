# Spring Library Forge

Spring Library Forge is a web application developed to serve as an Integrated Library System (ILS) utilizing modern technologies. This README provides an overview of the project's functionalities, requirements, and technologies used.

## Required Technologies

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot, Security, JDBC
- Gradle: 8.6
- JUnit5, AssertJ, TestContainers, Mockito
- PostgreSQL

## Functionality and Requirements

### Authentication
- Users can register with the application by providing email, username, password, and password confirmation.
- Email/username must be unique and should not contain special symbols.
- Passwords are securely stored using encryption techniques.
- Users can log in using their username/email and password.
- Password reset functionality is available via recovery code/link sent to the user's email.
- Support for Remember-me feature for persistent user sessions.
- Users can enable/disable remember-me functionality during login.
- Remember-me token increases inactivity time, with automatic logout after 7 days of inactivity.
- Users can manually log out, with automatic logout after 2 hours of inactivity.

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with multiple user roles.
- Role hierarchy implemented (User < Admin < Super Admin).
- Admin interface for user management, role assignment, and resource management.
- Admin can reset user passwords, with email notification.
- Super Administrator can elevate regular users to admin and vice versa.
- Only one instance of Super Administrator allowed, cannot be assigned to anyone else.

### Code Quality and Structure
- Business logic covers all required functionalities.
- Achieve a minimum test coverage of 85% for critical components.
- Unit tests using JUnit and Mockito for business logic.
- Integration tests validate interactions between components.
- Organized application into layers (presentation, service, data access).
- Separation of concerns between layers for maintainability.
- Clean and modular code following coding best practices.
- All API endpoints in the "rest-api" Gradle module, business logic in the "domain" module.

### API and Data Integrity
- Exposed endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP methods.
- GET-all API supports pagination.
- Data passed via request bodies, path parameters, and path variables.
- Server-side validation for all incoming data.
- Prevention of common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS.

### Additional Requirements
- User interface includes Login, Register, and password recovery pages.
- Swagger used for documenting other endpoints.
- Logging framework such as Log4j or SLF4J for centralized logging.

## Project Structure
- The project is structured following clean architecture principles.
- Presentation layer includes controllers and UI components.
- Service layer handles business logic.
- Data access layer interacts with the database.
- Gradle modules are organized into logical components.

## Configuration
- Annotations and properties used to create beans and configure applications.
- Development and Production profiles are implemented.
- Database structure generated by Flyway migrations, including Super Admin insertion.
